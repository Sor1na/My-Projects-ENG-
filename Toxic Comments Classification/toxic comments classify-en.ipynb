    "**Work Stages**: The project for \"Wikishop\" included several key stages. First, data was imported and preprocessed from the file toxic_comments.csv, with special attention given to balancing toxic and non-toxic comments. Next came text tokenization using BertTokenizer from DeepPavlov and conversion into embeddings using the BERT model. The data was then split into training, test, and validation sets, followed by the training of two models: Logistic Regression and a Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results and Conclusions**: As a result, the Logistic Regression model outperformed all other models, achieving an F1 score of 0.92 on the validation set and 0.72 on the test set, with accuracy 95%. This indicates the high effectiveness of the selected model in classifying comments as toxic or non-toxic. Thus, the task of creating a tool to filter out toxic comments for \"Wikishop\" was successfully accomplished."
